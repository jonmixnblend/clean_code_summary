# Clean code summary

This is a summary of the book (Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship)[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code], by Robert C. Martin.

It's in a cheatsheet format for [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash), and is generated using the [cheatset](https://github.com/Kapeli/cheatset) gem.

To generate a docset from these files, just read the instructions contained in the README.md
for that gem, and then open it with Dash.

This summary is based on the [notes by J. Barroso](https://github.com/jbarroso/clean-code)

I have merely changed them slightly in some places,and organised them into sections and chapters
with in dash to make them a bit more searchable from within that application.
