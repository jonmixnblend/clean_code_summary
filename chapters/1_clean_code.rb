            What Is Clean Code?:

            * Broken windows concept: If there is one broken window in a building it looks like nobody cares about it (the building).
            * **Code without tests is not clean.**
            * Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares.
            * **No duplication**, one thing, expressiveness, tiny abstractions.
            * It does pretty much as you expected: obvious, simple and compelling.
            * To write new code we need to read the old.
            * The ratio of time spent reading vs writing is 10:1.
            * Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.
            * The clean up does not have to be something big.

            * Bad code can bring a company down.
            * There are not excuses for bad code, no reasons: your boss does not give you time,
            you want to finish faster to get more backlog's stories finished, etc.
            * I will clean it later... **Later equals never**.

        notes <<-'END'
            If you decide to redesign your system, with a different team, maybe you will get:

            * Two teams in a race (the maintenance/existing system team, and the re-design team).
            * Years of development are necessary to provide the same features
            * People will leave the company and the redesign becomes a messy for newer members and they want to redesign it again...
            * Why does this happen to code? requirements?, stupid managers?, schedules ?? **No**.
            * It is all about unprofessionalism.
            * Most managers want good code. We have to help them to understand the risks of bad code.
            * The only way to go fast is to get the code as clean as possible.
            * Writing clean code require discipline. We need to work hard to get "code-sense".
